Hello! Welcome to my new, derpy website/blog! This is the first post of (hopefully) many. 
My goals for this website are to post any ideas that are worth developing into larger posts, exploring any technical topics 
I find interesting, and being a compilation of my body of work as a engineer/programmer.

I'm still not sure what this will ultimately turn into, but hopefully it'll be something worthwhile.

As a warm-up exercise, I'm going to be documenting my journey from the default Jekyll website to something I can call my own.
I've basically gotten to the point where I have something functioning and that's it.
In case you're reading this a little into the future, here's an idea of where that is...

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/NewHomePage.png" alt="New Home Page" style="width: 540px;"/>
<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/NewPostPage.png" alt="New Post Page" style="width: 540px;"/>

As you can see, a lot of the default website is still there. I don't have my Twitter account linked to it and I don't have my
GitHub page URL in there either. Even the original title and the original post that Jekyll generates is still there, mostly for my reference.
While it's taken me a while to do some of these things, I haven't really done a whole lot.

To get to this point, I've done the following things...

 *  Made a website
 *  Found somewhere to host it!
 *  Learned how to use Git!
 *  Figured out a way to add pictures!
 *  Began to get used to Markdown!

There will be posts after this going into detail on how I did these things, but for
right now this is going to be the end of the first post, mostly so I can get this thing up and going!
